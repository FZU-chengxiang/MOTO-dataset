Use numpy.load to load the .npy file
1~2 channels are the  displacement fields in X and Y direction
3 channel is the volume fraction field
4 channel is the stress fraction field
5~8 channels are the  strain fields of  sigma_x, sigma_y and tau_xy
9~10 channels are the  boundary condition in X and Y direction
11~12 channels are the  force in X and Y direction
The last channel is the label
